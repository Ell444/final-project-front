                    <strong>Usefull informations: </strong>
                    The Kanto region (Japanese: カントー地方 Kanto region) is a region of the Pokémon world. Kanto is located east of Johto, which together form a joint landmass that is south of Sinnoh.
                    Kanto is the setting of the first generation of games and can be explored in Generations II, III, IV, and VII.
                    All cities in Kanto are named after colors, with the exception of Pallet Town, which refers to a palette, meaning a range of colors. Unlike every other region, Kanto's fictional name reflects its real-world name.

                    <strong>Some history: </strong>
                    The Kanto region has a rich history of creating Pokémon with technology.
                    Many researchers have had great success in creating life in Kanto. A researcher once cloned Mew through its genes and created the Genetic Pokémon Mewtwo. Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon, was also created by researchers in Kanto.
                    In contemporary history, Red/Leaf is given a Pokémon by Professor Oak for personal safety. Professor Oak also gives his grandson, Blue, a Pokémon and asks Blue and Red/Leaf to help him fill the Pokédex, a complete encyclopedia on Pokémon. Thus, the journey of Red/Leaf begins. Red/Leaf travels across the Kanto region and collects all eight Gym Badges. During their journey, Red/Leaf comes across Team Rocket, an evil organization behind the theft and illegal profit of Pokémon. Red/Leaf stops Team Rocket and defeats Giovanni, their boss, as well as the Gym Leader of Viridian Gym, who then disbands Team Rocket. In the meantime, Blue, who has also collected all of the Kanto Gym Badges, defeats the Elite Four at the Indigo League and becomes the champion of the Kanto region. Finally, Red/Leaf also reaches the Indigo League and defeats Blue to gain the title of the new Indigo League Champion.
